## Deep Learning in economic indicator forecasting: The case of Brazil's primary fiscal result.


This repository contains all the code files used in the Master Thesis final project for the Master of Data Science program at the Hertie School in Berlin, Germany.

This project uses Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) statistical models as a baseline to compare with deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to predict Brazilian Primary Balance. For that purpose, the models were trained using a dataset that contains monthly data from 2001-2023 for 69 independent variables and one dependent variable.

This project was implemented in Python using several different libraries. To organize and clearly state the references, each code script includes, at the beginning of the file, the references used, data sources, and applied packages.

This is the general structure of this repository:
